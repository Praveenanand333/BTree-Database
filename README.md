# Student Database with B-tree Implementation

This project is a student database implemented using a B-tree data structure in C++. The B-tree allows efficient storage, retrieval, modification, and deletion of student records in the database.

## Features

The student database provides the following features:

1. Add a Student Record: Add a new student record to the database by providing the student's information such as name, ID, and other relevant details.

2. Delete a Student Record: Remove a student record from the database using the student's ID.

3. Modify a Student Record: Update the information of an existing student record, such as modifying their name, ID, or any other relevant details.

4. Search for a Student Record: Retrieve a student record from the database using the student's ID or other search criteria.

## Requirements

To compile and run the student database, you need the following:

- C++ compiler compatible with C++11 or higher.
- Standard Template Library (STL) support.

## Usage

To use the student database, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Compile the source code using the C++ compiler. For example:

   ```
   g++ main.cpp -o student_database
   ```

4. Run the compiled executable:

   ```
   ./student_database
   ```

5. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the student database.

## B-tree Implementation Details

The student database utilizes a B-tree data structure for efficient storage and retrieval of student records. The B-tree provides the following advantages:

- Balanced Tree Structure: The B-tree ensures a balanced tree structure, maintaining a reasonable height and optimizing search, insert, delete, and modify operations.

- Efficient Search: Searching for a student record in the B-tree has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of records in the database.

- Ordered Storage: The B-tree stores student records in sorted order, allowing for efficient range-based queries and traversals.

- Disk-Based Storage: The B-tree is designed to handle large datasets that may not fit entirely in memory. It minimizes disk I/O operations and optimizes the use of cache.
